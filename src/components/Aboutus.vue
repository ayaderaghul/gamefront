      I intend to create a flat hierarchy classroom that sparks and facillitates everyone's idea. It is a project that spawns projects. An incubation house. In that garden, I sow my own project: a game theory class. <br><br>

      What is The League? The League comprises of members who do projects. <br>
      Why hire The League? Trust me, it is time for heavy R&D to meet the industry. <br>

      Why join The League? Do cool projects, get cheered from community, get coached from community, get HIRED !!! It is time to raise your income level, do that by training with the best.
