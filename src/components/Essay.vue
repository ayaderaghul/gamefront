    Hi ***,<br><br>
I tried Mathematica. It expresses and animates my thoughts  gracefully. With access to people's Mathematica notebook, I imagine we  could automate the evaluation of the style, and structure of their  thoughts, to some good degree. Are you doing it?<br><br>
When Wittgenstein says the limit of my language is the limit of my  world, I think he means the limit of my tools is the limit of my world.  Augmenting tools to better express oneself is, I think, the ultimate  goal. Machine, in that vein, is some thing that evolves out of us, like  we evolved out of nature. And "they" carry humanity's hope and dream.<br><br>
About my work, I code finite state machines playing games. For  example, it evolves a machine that using the same prior probabilistic  plan, can distinguish different types. It cooperates with its own kind  and repels others. (Part of the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ES43RPohNiWf1_Eds_iRHGBJwAwDfZx0/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">work</a>)<br><br>
+ I would like to develop an online environment for learners to code  and have fun with these machines. (My Pioneer <a href="https://houseaya.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank"> project</a>). You have assembled an enormous labor  force, can you share advice about being a leader?<br><br>
+ We are coding drone environment for reinforcement learning (RL).  (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IvFGEg9ErI" target="_blank">Demo</a>). The drone has  stabilised and reached target. Are you working on RL? How do you feel  about it?<br><br>
+ What is the current state of a machine that can generate proof for  any statement? Do you aim for computational language to go there?<br><br>
We thank you for your help!

    Hi ***,<br><br>
I checked your Linkedin, your background was about Maths and C++ and  now you are working on Search & NLP, among the hardest problems  right now, in Apple. Can I ask you how did you push through and  withstand that much pressure? (Do you have advice for a female?)<br><br>
I work on evolutionary game theory simulation in Scheme (and it is my  main Pioneer <a href="https://houseaya.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">project</a> but during the  tournament, I grew a community of academics on <a href="https://discord.gg/Jbjj6NS" target="_blank">discord</a>. Turns out that we are people who find joy  working on hard problems.<br><br>
We have students who made aeroplane pressure probe, joined fusion  reactor and particle hunting lab, etc. We see stochastic reinforcement  learning and evolution as something strangely good in seeking extremum  points in an unknown and uncertainty landscape. What interesting thing  you learn recently (or papers you read) about RL and search algorithm?  Facebook is trying to make use of RL in the industry, how is it at  Apple?<br><br>
About NLP, we have some questions:  <br><br>
- Based on a sequence of an user's response, we can use Bayesian or  reinforcement learning to deduct user preference. But do you know if  these kind of algorithms are used in the industry yet? Or it is  something simpler?<br><br>
- Based on the taken note of a student, we can evaluate the matching  level of her understanding with the teacher's idea. Currently, how  accurate do you think we can do this (percentage)?<br><br>
- To somewhat conclude, can you describe briefly the way (the  algorithm) we are now telling computer to find the semantic meaning of a  document? (Breaking down the sentence, training with big data..etc)<br><br>
We thank you for your help!

      <p>
That's a great start! And very cool stuff!<br><br>

<code>>You and your team have built an enormous userbase, what can you say to a person that needs experience in networking, growth, and market?</code><br><br>


Thanks, I would just keep doing what you're doing with building the product and community. Read books and listen to podcasts. Engage with people on Twitter and at events.
<br><br>
<code>
>Can you point out something you see to improve?
</code><br><br>

It's not entirely clear from your landing page what your value proposition is. Make sure to iterate on the marketing and messaging. Once people start telling their friends about you then you know you've made something sticky and valuable.
<br><br>

<code>>I hesitate a bit to show HackerNews, how did you overcome embarrassment?</code><br><br>


Just do it! And keep doing it. Eventually you'll overcome it. Everyone is winging it :)<br><br>

<p>      Hi ***,<br><br>
I created a coding community. And I want to have excited people  speaking about their deploys like it is the future. I want to "grow"  people like you and would like to ask you how.<br><br>
Currently we have students working on drones and robotics for fun.  They speak about nuclear fusion and hunting axion particles on my  discord server. Others hack their asian chess and ancient history,  programming.. I want to inspire them to code and grow, so that they  inspire further. I want a Ponzi scheme of inspiration :)<br><br>
<p>Here is my Pioneer <a href="https://houseaya.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">project</a>. We have  ~120 members on <a href="https://discord.gg/5NthDYE" target="_blank">discord</a> with academic  background (physics, maths, AI..). This weekend we do a tiny <a href="https://Personal-Blog-Site--ayaderaghul.repl.co" target="_blank">hackathon</a> and there are ~15  <a href="https://Personal-Blog-Site-1--ayaderaghul.repl.co" target="_blank">players</a>. One fun <a href="https://calculate-diagonal.shithitthefan.repl.run/" target="_blank">example</a>. Also demos  that are meaningful on heroku <a href="https://leso-tanvan.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">app</a>. <br><br>
You and your team have built an enormous userbase, what can you say  to a person that needs experience in networking, growth, and market? Can  you introduce me to advisor, VC or PR outlet that match? Can you point  out something you see to improve? I hesitate a bit to show HackerNews,  how did you overcome embarrassment?<br><br>
We thank you for your help :)
